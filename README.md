## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run server`

Starts the json server for local development.\
Open [http://localhost:3001/books](http://localhost:3001/books) to view it in your browser.\

Also check `api.http` for example requests and `db.json` to get insights of the current state of the json server.
